# Git Insight Development Notes

### 1 Setup

- `npx create-next-app@latest`
- `cd git-insight`
- `npm run dev`
- Optional: If you face any error during npm run dev ex: with code `EACCES` then run `sudo chmod -R 777 .`

### 2 Add cursorrules

### 3 Add button on home page to direct to dashboard and add dashboard page starter code

prompt used:

```
Clean up the home page @page.tsx. And add just one button at center that redirects the user to the /dashboards route. The /dashboards page will serve as a dedicated dashboard for managing API keys. Implement a user interface on the dashboard page to support full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for API keys. Ensure the design is user-friendly and follows standard UI/UX practices.
```

- Fix errors if composer fails to generate code properly
