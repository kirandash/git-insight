# Git Insight Development Notes

### 1 Setup

- `npx create-next-app@latest` use pnpm
- `cd git-insight`
- `npm run dev`
- Optional: If you face any error during npm run dev ex: with code `EACCES` then run `sudo chmod -R 777 .`

### 2 Add cursorrules

### 3 Install all dependencies

- shadcn/ui, lucide, zod

```prompt.txt
let's install shadcnui
```

### 3 Add button on home page to direct to dashboard and add dashboard page starter code

prompt used:

```prompt.txt
Clean up the home page @page.tsx. And add just one button at center that redirects the user to the /dashboards route. The /dashboards page will serve as a dedicated dashboard for managing API keys. Implement a user interface on the dashboard page to support full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for API keys. Ensure the design is user-friendly and follows standard UI/UX practices.
```

```prompt.txt
for @ApiKeyDashboard.tsx change interface to types
```

- Fix errors if composer fails to generate code properly

ex:

```prompt.txt
let's update @ApiKeyForm.tsx @ApiKeyList.tsx and @ApiKeyDashboard.tsx to use shadcnui components rather than native input, btn etc
```

```prompt.txt
in @ApiKeyForm.tsx we should not have an input for api key. the key should be auto generated. we only need the name for the key
```

### 4 Improve UI to match the design screenshot

- take a screenshot of the design and ask the composer to make our UI look like this. You can also provide reference code from v0 or if you have figma you can use figma to html converter plugin to share the starting code.

```prompt.txt
I like this design. Make our UI look like this. you can update
@page.tsx , @ApiKeyForm.tsx, @ApiKeyList.tsx, @ApiKeyDashboard.tsx etc

feel free to create new components if necessary
```

### 5 Improve API Key Section to match the design screenshot

- As global screenshot of whole page might not be always correct
- so next step will be to go step by step and fix the individual components

```prompt.txt
The @ApiKeySection.tsx does not match with design let's improve that and make sure it matches with the design shared
```

```prompt.txt
currently ui is not fully functional. in add api key dialog if user adds a new key it should show on the table
```

```prompt.txt
also by default can we have two keys that are displayed in table on page load
```

```prompt.txt
on clicking edit, the edit modal should launch  with the values pre filled as shown in design
```

### 6 Integrate supabase and CRUD

- create a supabase account
- create a new project

- create .env.local file

```prompt.txt
@ApiKeySection.tsx I want to connect the CRUD APIs ehre to a supabase database
```

- response:

```SQL
create table api_keys (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) not null,
  name text not null,
  key text not null,
  usage integer default 0,
  limit text,
  limit_enabled boolean default false,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) not null
);
```

- api key from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pypwscdgfkrguzfkeusa/settings/api

- if you don't want auth in the beginning you can disable RLS in supabase and CRUD will work

- fix copy to clipboard

```prompt.txt
copy key feature does not seem to be working @ApiKeySection.tsx
```

- delete notification background should be red

```prompt.txt
delete notification background should be red
```

### 7 Sidebar

```prompt.txt
help me create a sidebar component that will be used in the dashboard page. As shown in the screenshot
```

```prompt.txt
Make sure the sidebar is hideable. Add a button to toggle the sidebar
```

### 8 Review and refactor

- It's a good practice to add unit and e2e tests to catch any breaking changes during refactor

```prompt.txt
I want to refactor my code.
The file @ApiKeySection.tsx is chunky. It has a lot of logic and components in it and is 300+ lines. Although I want my components to be small and focused and less than 300 lines. Currently the file has the CRUD API fetching and the API Key related components. I want to split this file into smaller files so the code is more readable and maintainable.
```

- During refactor composer might not use correct extensions ex: .tsx, .ts etc. So make sure to check the file extension and use correct one. Also, you might want to add the hooks folder in tailwind.config.ts to compile the styles

### 9 Protect route with API key verification

- route: /playground
  - it should call a 'validate-key' API to check if the key is valid
  - if key is valid, then render the protected page
  - if key is invalid, then show error toast

```prompt.txt
In the @sidebar.tsx file when user clicks on "API playground" link, it should take user to a new page /playground. The playground page will have a form to submit an api key and a button to submit the request.

After the request is submitted, it should take user to the /protected route. And there we will validate that the key is indeed a valid api key. If the key is valid, then render the protected page and show a success toast with the message "Key is valid. /protected route is now accessible". If the key is invalid, then show error toast with the message "Key is invalid. Please enter a valid key".
```

### 10 Documenting curl commands

```prompt.txt
show me the corresponding curl commands based on the screenshot for validate-key. Add the documentation to a new file that will have the api documentation
```

### 11 Deploy to vercel

### 12 Git Insight Project Overview

- we will build an api ex: api/git-insight
- it will take a payload of "githubUrl" and return "summary" and "cool_facts" in response
- the api should be only callable with a valid api key

  - key: x-api-key
  - value: git-insight-api-key
  - add to: header

- Additional features that might be useful in a real SaaS product:
  - SSO login
  - rate limiting
  - counting API usage
  - payment gateway

### 13 Switch package manager from npm to yarn, Install langchain

- we will use langchain for building our llm powered backend
- npm might have some issues with langchain so prefer to use yarn

```prompt.txt
let's switch the package manager from npm to yarn
```

- `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
- `npm install -g yarn`
- `yarn`

- install langchain: https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/installation/

- `yarn add langchain @langchain/core`
- `yarn add @langchain/community`
- `yarn add @langchain/openai`

### 14 Setup postman collection to test the api on local and production

### 15 git-insight api and Fetch readme content of github repository (cursor inline editing with Cmd + K)

- cursor composer:

```prompt.txt
@route.ts Create a new api endpoint /api/git-insight. It will have the same implementation as the /api/validate-key/route.ts. I want to use it as boilerplate for the git-insight api.
```

- inline editing or composer:

```prompt.txt
@route.ts Implement the logic to fetch the readme content of the github repository.
```

### 16 Langchain integration for git-insight api

```prompt.txt
generate a langchain chain from @langchain-js that will get a prompt of "Summarize the readme content of the github repository" then inject the readmeContent to the prompt.

The chain will invoke an llm and structure the output to a JSON object with the following fields:
- summary: string
- cool_facts: array of strings
```

- use the @docs to mention the langchain js docs

- The api response from llms might not be in the correct format. So we need to use a parser to parse the output to the correct format. We will use zod to parse the output to the correct format.

```prompt.txt
use StructuredOutputParser and make the structured output strict with a zod schema
```

### 17 Refactor readmeAnalysisChain to use `withStructuredOutput` method

https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/structured_output/#the-.withstructuredoutput-method

```prompt.txt
refactor the @readmeAnalysisChain.ts  to use the withStructuredOutput method @LangChain
```

### 17 Authentication flow setup with next-auth, OAuth client, Secrets

- install next-auth
  - https://authjs.dev/
  - `yarn add next-auth@beta`
- create google cloud project
- Create OAuth consent screen
- Create OAuth Client
- Create secrets and update in .env

```prompt.txt
On @page.tsx  implement the google SSO flow. Add a login button in @page.tsx

Follow the documentation from @AuthJS (NextAuth)
```

- https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=Next.js

```prompt.txt
create a redirect util "protectRoute" which we can then call in individual pages to see if a route is protected or not
```

### 18 Authentication and DB

- Create 'users' table in supabase
- When user signs in for the first time, we will add a new DB record for the user

```prompt.txt
When user signs in for the first time, add a new record in the users table in supabase. the auth related files are @auth.ts and @route.ts . and supabase client is at @supabaseClient.ts
```

- You might want to disable RLS for users table in supabase to make it easier to test (Not recommended for production)

### 19 Landing page with Cursor Composer

```prompt.txt
@page.tsx  Create a beautiful landing page for a github analyzer tool. It uses AI on github open source repository and generates a summary and cool facts about the repository.

For inspiration I have shared a landing page design. Use that design but create your own content to align with the github analyzer tool. Make sure it is responsive too.

Choose a color pallette that aligns with the design shared
```

- lift "Blocks" from shadcn/ui into v0 and you can ask to repurpose it for a specific use case ex: recreate this block for API usage

### 20 Better Landing page with v0, shadcn/ui, cursor composer

- prompt v0

  - to give you a layout of the page

  ```prompt.txt (ideal with v0)
  Build a Next.js landing page for a saas application called "Git Insight". The application uses AI on github open source repository and generates a summary and cool facts about the repository.

  The landing page should be responsive and have a beautiful design.
  It should have a Sign up / Login button and a pricing with a free tier.

  Use shadcn/ui for the components
  ```

  ```prompt.text (mine with cursor composer)
  The landing page is for a saas application called "Git Insight". Also the landing page should have a pricing section with a free tier

  Use @shadcn/ui Kit components throught the page wherever possible
  ```

- step by step
- install shadcn
- configure shadcn components
- integrate code

- Inspired from theme: silicon

### 21 Make dashboard responsive

```prompt.txt
Hide the sidebar on mobile devices
```

TODO: Fix the overflow issue on mobile devices

### 22 Add coming soon info to the landing page

- add coming soon info to the landing page for enterprise section

```prompt.txt
@page.tsx add coming soon info to the enterprise custom pricing section. make sure to add it in a nice way.
```

### 23 Add API demo component to the landing page

```prompt.txt
Add a new section with a new component to the landing page that will demo the API. I have attached a screenshot of the postman request.

Please do create a new component file for this for better readability.

By default, the demo should show the original request from the screenshot but let the user change the request and see the response.

Also add a "Documentation" button to the demo component that will take the user to the documentation page.
```

```prompt.txt
move the APIDemo section in @page.tsx before how it works
```

```prompt.txt
also add a button to the @ApiDemo.tsx section that will help us try the api. and also on submit it should call the api and show the response. the api should be @route.ts
```

### 24 Add support for lowercase readme file name in git-insight api

```prompt.txt
in @route.ts also add support for lowercase "readme" while fetching readme content
```

## REST APIs

### 25 REST APIs for all the routes and Cursor Notepad

- currently our db calls are being made on client side. We need to move them to server side

- We will use Cursor Notepad feature to provide context for the current composer. .cursorrules gives context for the global composer. But if we want a bunch of context only for the current composer, we can use Cursor Notepad.
  - It will be useful while fixing bugs or working on a PR etc.
  - Add any high level context to the notepad so that the composer can use it
- use .cursorrules for project wide context
- use Cursor Notepad for small task level context ex: fixing a bug, working on a PR etc. Only for the current task

### 26 Prompt Engineering for CRUD API

Notepad (CRUD):

```prompt.txt (Notepad)
Implement a CRUD API for management API keys, the original code is in @use-api-keys.tsx
For auth use NextAuth.js v5
```

```prompt.txt (Cursor Composer)
I want you to:
1.Move all the CRUD in @apiKeyOperations.js functionality to be under a REST endpoint which can only be invoked from an authenticated user. Make sure to implement also [id] endpoints

2. All operations should work only for a specific user_id. You can get the user id from retrieving the email from the JWT and searching for its corresponding user in the Supabase DB.
Use auth function on server side instead of getServersession
3.remember to use @supabaseClient.js for Supabase interaction

Use @NextJS  @CRUD and @AuthJS (NextAuth)
```

- Tip: Try to implement small features in a prompt. This will have more accuracy and will also be easier to review and debug.
  - DO NOT try to implement a big feature in a single prompt.
- Tip: Add some implementation details to the prompt ex: the dynamic route etc

```prompt.txt
currently the api key generation is on client side in @ApiKeySection.tsx can we move it to server side
```

### 27 Improvements to the UI for CRUD API

💡 Cursor Tips:

- Press '/' to open additional options:
  - To Reset the composer
  - To Reference all Open Editors

```prompt.txt
key name should be editable
```

```prompt.txt
when api is called, during loading state the form inputs should be disabled and button text should update to saving

or feel free to implement if you have a better feature in mind for saving state
```

### 28 Fix build issue caused by dynamic route types

```prompt.txt
i am getting the error. and i found a solution here

 @https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route#context-optional

please follow the solution and see if it can be correctly used to solve the type issue for this dynamic route
```

### 29 Adding Retaliating and Quota enforcement

- we want to add rate limiting and quota enforcement
  - so if user has used the api keys usage credits, we should not allow them to use the api
- use the usage column

```prompt.txt
I want you to implement rate limiting protection to /git-insightAPI in @route.js.

I want each time a user invokes a certain API key, to increment the API key usage column of the corresponding API key in Supabase.

I want you then to check if the usage is lower than the limit of the API key.

If it is larger, you should return in the response a 429 and that there is a rate limit.
```

### 30 Refactor git-insight route

```prompt.txt
@route.ts make the code more reusable. create a function that checks the limit so it can be used in future endpoints
```

### 31 Improvements - add limit column to api keys section on dashboard

- Also add a default rate limit of 100 requests per day in the supabase table

```prompt.txt
in @ApiKeySection.tsx can we add limit column as well
```
